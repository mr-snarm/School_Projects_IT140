The second project for my introduction to scripting class was focused on scripting a short grocery list in Python as an exercise in dictionaries and lists.

After initializing the an empty list and dictionary, the script prompts the user through the console for an item's name, quantity, and price.
User input then fills those values and saves them to a copy of that dictionary in a list that stores each grocery item. The console then prompts the user to
continue or quit; upon an input of anything but "Q," the script is run in a loop. If the user inputs "Q," the script then collects all of the dictionaries in
the original list, outputs item's name, quantity, and cost, and then prints the total cost for all of the items.
